# Scripts directory README.md

For replicating the analysis you'll mostly want to be interacting with master\_script.bsh in the directory above this one.

For understanding what is being done in that master script you're in the right place.

Master script and the scripts it calls visit these directories mostly in the numbered order of the subdirectories of this folder, with the exception of 09\_polyacalling/, which was added slightly later.
