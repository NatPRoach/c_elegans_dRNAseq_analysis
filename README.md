# c\_elegans\_dRNAseq\_analysis
Github repository for scripts related to the analysis of _C elegans_ dRNA sequencing data.

Note that many of the scripts as written use explicit filepaths meaning it may take some effort to replicate the analysis. I'll be updating these scripts and this directory in the coming days and weeks to make this more portable and easier to replicate.

Requirements:

Python:
- python2
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pysam
- pybedtools

R:
- R
- ggplot2

Other:
- bedtools
- samtools
- minimap2
